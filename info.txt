This is a library for a bare-metal system implementation on a Raspberry Pi, emulating the functionality of an Apple II Computer.
This was done over the course of a quarter through cs107e. I Engineered a GPIO, timer, strings, printf, malloc, backtrace, ps2, keyboard, graphics, and interrupts modules in the C language.
